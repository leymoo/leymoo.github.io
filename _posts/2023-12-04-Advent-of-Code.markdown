## Â How far can I get in Advent of Code 2023 without actually coding?

It's become a bit of a tradition for various people I know to do advent of code. For those who do not know, it's one (well, 2 kinda) coding challenges a day from December to December 24.

I spend a lot of time reading code and not ever writing it these days. I google, read it, copy/paste with a few edits and off I go. So I am now wondering... how far can I get without writing a single line of code? What can I achieve with a text editor and off the shelf software?

Few rules (to make it fun, honest):

1. Excel or google sheets are fine
2. I must use code or formulae I copy/paste from websites I have obtained with a search engine
3. Regex is ok in text editors but only if I've copy/pasted it from elsewhere
4. No ChatGPT or similar sorts of MML help for now (lots of people having fun with this option this year)

Wish me luck!
