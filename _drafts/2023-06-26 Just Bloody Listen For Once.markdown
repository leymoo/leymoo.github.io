I see a lot of questions that follow this format:

Hi, I'm a developer and we are trying to get our designers to work with us in our setup, but they keep wittering on about "design thinking" and "double diamond". 
Hi, I'm a designer and we are trying to get our developers to work with us in our setup of blah, but they keep wittering on about agile development and won't work with us. 
Hi, I'm a Product Manager, why won't everyone follow this Lean Startup thing I read about in a book? 
Hi, I'm a scrum master, why won't....

You get the idea. 

Part of the problem is that each individual specialty has invented ways of working that started with their problems, and then *after this point* they looked outwards to other team roles to integrate with "their" way of working. This is not just a business problem, this is often a problem in academia too. 

And they all have their jargon. It pollutes LinkedIn, and conference talk titles. 

So this is a shortish post to give you an alternative: 

Listen to the other team/group, ask good questions, look for patterns. Are you both achieving the same thing? What can you learn from them?

Don't dogmatically stick to your own frameworks and templates. Learn from other disciplines. Learn from your colleagues.
