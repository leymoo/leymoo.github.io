what I love about this particular area is that various disciplines have converged to this area without realising the overlap between them. 

So this is my attempt to map out the differing sets of tools that overlap with systems thinking. 

Broadly, you can categorise into:
- Person interacting with object
- persons interacting with object
- Person interacting with group of persons
- persons interacting with persons

# Person interacting with object:
## From the design field you have:
UI Design
UX Design
Interaction Design
Visual Design
then for ways of working/thinking:
Design Thinking
Double Diamond

## From the business field you have:


## From software engineering you have
Systems Analysis 
UML (certain diagrams, not all, should clarify which ones)


# Multiple People interacting with Object

## Design
- various bits about B2B user, stakeholders etc

## Business
- b2b marketing stoof

## software engineering

# person interacting with multiple people

## Design


## Business
Value Chain Mapping 

## software engineering
- soft systems modelling eg stakeholder analysis 



UX / User Experience Design
