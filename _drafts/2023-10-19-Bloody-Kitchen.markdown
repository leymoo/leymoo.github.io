## Â Things I have learnt while having a 4 month kitchen renovation

1. Having a splashback or a plumbed in sink without leaks is apparently a weird request.
2. You can have a builder sent from heaven and amazing people doing the work but if their coordinator/manager is badly organised, your life will be bad.
3. Kitchen counters can be different heights, and "normal" depends on country. I'm used to 90cm, we've ended up with 87cm.
4. People will think you are unhinged during this process. You cannot fix this aspect
5. Drilling channels in concrete is about... 95dB through two sets of walls and a door.
6. Light fittings vary a lot.
7. A fancy enough fridge will make up for a lot of issues
8. There are ants who do not care for sugar - we had a bunch swarming over a double clipped bag of flaked almonds and then ramen in the pile of food stored in another room, but the honey, sugars and jams were completely ignored.
9. Dropped ceilings make a big difference to the finished look
