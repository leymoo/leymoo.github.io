Hi, I'm Ashley Rolfmore.

If you are here because of the Technical Manifesto, [go here to read]({% post_url 2023-04-11-A Technical Manifesto %}) and if you agree, contact me to sign it. 

I post about topics that interest me, most of them are adjacent to what I do for a living or to relocating to Madeira. I love thinking about how technology affects lives and society, and I'm a bit of an organisational behaviour nerd.

If you're interested in hiring me, [go here]({% post_url 2023-04-11-For-Hire %}).

I also share two amazing cats with my husband, one shorthair and one longhair. They have proper names, but they never really respond to those names, so I have nicknamed one floof and one derp.
